        "**2. What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It translates each line of code into machine language so the computer can understand and run it. Python doesn’t need to be compiled before running; instead, the interpreter runs the code directly, which makes it easier to test and debug.\n",

        "  Explanation:\n",
        "  - You start with an if statement.\n",
        "\n",

        " - Python while loop is the control flow statement that repeats a block of code till the time a specified condition is 'True'.

        "- Conclusion ;\n",
        "\n",
        "  Both for and while loops are essential in programming, and the choice between them depends on the nature of the problem. Use for loops for fixed repetitions and while loops for conditions that depend on runtime behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance. For example, in a login system where a user is repeatedly asked to enter the correct password, a while loop is used to keep prompting until the correct input is provided. This type of loop is ideal for condition-based repetition."
